# Railway Deployment Fix - Import Errors Resolved ‚úÖ

## Problem

Railway deployment was failing with the following error:

```
ImportError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package
```

The error occurred in multiple files:
- `core/orchestrator.py` line 33: `from ..models.agents import PresentationStrawman, Slide`
- `services/*.py`: All service files using relative imports
- `clients/*.py`: All client files using relative imports

## Root Cause

When Railway runs the application using `uvicorn main:app`, it treats `main.py` as the **top-level entry point**, not as part of a package. This means:

- Relative imports with `..` try to go "above" the top level
- Python raises `ImportError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package`
- The application fails to start

## Solution

Changed all imports from **relative** to **absolute** format:

### Before (Relative Imports ‚ùå)
```python
# In core/orchestrator.py
from ..models.agents import PresentationStrawman, Slide
from ..services.request_builder import RequestBuilder

# In clients/mock_text_client.py
from ..models.director_models import GeneratedText

# In services/request_builder.py
from ..utils.guidance_parser import parse_guidance
```

### After (Absolute Imports ‚úÖ)
```python
# In core/orchestrator.py
from models.agents import PresentationStrawman, Slide
from services.request_builder import RequestBuilder

# In clients/mock_text_client.py
from models.director_models import GeneratedText

# In services/request_builder.py
from utils.guidance_parser import parse_guidance
```

### Additional Fix in main.py

Added path manipulation to ensure absolute imports work:

```python
# Import v2 orchestrator and clients
# Use absolute imports for production compatibility
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Add current directory to path to allow absolute imports
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent))

from core.orchestrator import ContentOrchestratorV2
from clients.mock_text_client import MockTextClient
# ... rest of imports
```

## Files Modified

9 files were updated:

1. **main.py** - Added sys.path manipulation
2. **core/orchestrator.py** - Changed imports
3. **services/request_builder.py** - Changed imports
4. **services/result_stitcher.py** - Changed imports
5. **services/sla_validator.py** - Changed imports
6. **clients/mock_text_client.py** - Changed imports
7. **clients/mock_chart_client.py** - Changed imports
8. **clients/mock_image_client.py** - Changed imports
9. **clients/mock_diagram_client.py** - Changed imports

## Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
# Compile check
python3 -m py_compile main.py
# ‚úÖ No errors

# Import test
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '.'); from main import app; print('Imports successful!')"
# ‚úÖ Imports successful!
```

### Railway Testing

After pushing the fix to GitHub:

1. Railway automatically detects the new commit
2. Railway rebuilds the application
3. Health check endpoint should now work: `GET /health`
4. Expected response:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "version": "2.0.0",
     "orchestrator": "ready"
   }
   ```

## Commits

- **Initial commit**: `b2f9329` - feat: Content Orchestrator v2.0 - Railway deployment ready
- **Fix commit**: `a476867` - fix: Change relative imports to absolute imports for Railway compatibility

## Verification Steps

Once Railway redeploys (should happen automatically):

1. **Check Railway logs** for successful startup
2. **Test health endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
   ```
3. **Test status endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/v2/status
   ```
4. **View API docs**:
   ```
   https://your-app.railway.app/docs
   ```

## Why This Works

### Development Mode (Local)
- `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent))` adds the v2 directory to Python's path
- Absolute imports like `from models.agents import ...` resolve correctly
- Works when running `python3 main.py` or `uvicorn main:app --reload`

### Production Mode (Railway)
- Railway runs `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- The current directory (`/app`) is automatically in the path
- Absolute imports work because `models/`, `services/`, `clients/` are in `/app/`
- No relative import issues since we're not using `..` notation

## Key Learnings

1. **Relative imports** (`..models`) work for packages but not when the entry point is at the package root
2. **Absolute imports** (`models`) work universally when combined with proper `sys.path` setup
3. **Railway** treats the repository root as `/app/` and runs commands from there
4. **FastAPI** with uvicorn needs the app to be importable, so import structure is critical

## If You Still Have Issues

If Railway deployment still fails:

1. **Check Railway logs** in the dashboard
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Check the Procfile** command is correct: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
4. **Test locally** with the exact Railway command:
   ```bash
   PORT=8000 uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
   ```

## Status

‚úÖ **Fix pushed to GitHub**: https://github.com/Pramod-Potti-Krishnan/content-orchestrator-2.0
‚úÖ **Railway should auto-deploy**: Check your Railway dashboard
‚úÖ **Health check should pass**: Wait ~2-3 minutes for deployment
